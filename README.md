# **Calorie Tracker application**

## **Proposal**-
This application can be used by fitness and health enthusiasts to keep a track of the number of
calories that they consume in a day so that they can reach their goal (i.e., losing weight or gaining weight).
*There are various misconceptions surrounding weight loss and weight gain in the fitness industry*. I had been 
overweight my entire life and had tried many unhealthy weight loss methods unsuccessfully. Last year, my friend
introduced me to calorie tracking. I have lost over 35 lbs since then. **Everybody's body is perfect just the way
it is and nobody should ever feel the need to under-eat because other people tell them to**. I just wanted to make
this application to help anyone interested in tracking calories and losing/gaining weight the healthy way.

## *User Stories*-
- As a user, I want to be able to track the number of calories I have consumed in the day.
- As a user, I want to be able to calculate the number of calories I require to maintain my body weight(aka. my basal metabolic rate).
- As a user, I want to be able to add my current body weight to a list of my previous body weights.
- As a user, I want to be able to view my list of body weights to monitor my progress.
